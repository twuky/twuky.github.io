              I've always loved how there has been a choice piece in portfolio presentations.
              For as long as I have been able to, I've tried to encorporate work outside of
              my school. I admit that part of this is that I think it's sneaky and feels like
              going behind the school's back, but I also believe there is some merit to it.
              My life doesn't end when I leave the school building; I'm entirely capable of
              learning off the school clock.

              My choice piece this year is the video game I made (and am making) for the convention
              described in my Presentation and Design piece. The game is called DJ Clips' Ultimate
              Pipe Dream - here's a video.

              The reason I put this as a choice peace is because I technically have been working on
              this since before the school year began. I showed off a much smaller game that I made
              last year, when the panelists were other students. This year's project really marks
              what I think is the beginning of my career in serious programming. What you see here
              was almost entirely made by me - bar some of the game's music. I started learning to
              code ruby around last June, and am really happy with where I am today. I would consider
              this project to be in "two parts", the other of which is covered in the "Design and Presentation"
              page. I should be bringing my laptop with me to the presentation in case you want to
              test out the game, or see any of the code I wrote.
