                    This is my cool portfolio site. I coded it myself because
                    the school wanted us to use google sites or something and
                    on there all the designs were boring and the same. This is
                    the second year MLC has been doing digital portfolios, and
                    as a senior I wanted to have a site that actually showed off
                    my skills. It looks pretty nice on phones, too, if that's
                    your thing.

                  I'm Tucker Johnson, currently a senior here. This is my
                last year in the 'sheltered bubble' that is the public high
                school system. As I've counted the years going here, I've slowly
                began to notice the important parts of my life shift away from
                school. For this "portfolio" presentation, I want to focus on
                work relating to my future, where I'm heading as an adult. As such,
                the pieces on my website this year are entirely unrelated to my
                school work. Every day I believe more and more that the ways I'm
                growing, both personally and in my careers are linked to the world
                outside of high school. The projects I'm showing are what I think
                are the best examples of what I can do on my own, a situation I'll
                be facing all-to-soon. I'm experienced with giving my portfolio
                by this point, so feel free to ask anything that's on your mind.
                Since these projects arent just school assignments, it's harder
                for them to "speak for themselves". Other than exploring my body
                of work, I hope most of what you learn can come from our discussion.
