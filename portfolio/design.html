              It's a little odd for me to be putting "running a convention booth" down
              as a type of presentation, but it's true! If anything bringing my game to
              <a href="http://pigsquad.com"> Portland Indie Game Squad's </a> annual
              Drink n' Draw night was probably the most important "presentation" I've
              been to this year. PIGsquad is a local nonprofit organization focused
              on supporting and rallying the local independant game developers. Members
              range from hobbyists like myself to professionals working in the industry.
              Drink n' Draw (surprisingly all-ages) is by far their largest event, and
              this year had attendance somewhere between 400-500!

              The event was hosted at a local event center - The Evergreen PDX. Set up
              began at 4:00 and I was around until the event ended at midnight. Definitely
              the longest  I brought
              DJ Clips, the game I focused on for my choice piece, which you should
              get a chance to play during my presentation.

              Preparing for this event was probably one of the most stressful experiences
              of my life. Ask any staff member about the week leading up to this, I'm sure
              they have some story to tell. Especially Michelle.

              I think one of the things i should have accounted for was being able to spread
              myself more. I didnt get an opportunity to print out business cards, and when
              I arrived I noticed basically everyone else had some. When I began the event,
              my game was a mess. It was crashing on boot, and I didn't get it stable until
              around a half hour after the event oficially started letting people in at 6.
              Things began to smooth out over the course of the night, and overall I was
              happy to have participated in the event. Honestly it was pretty intimidating
              to be in the same room, presenting my game alongside much larger-scale developers,
              folks who have actually made money from their work.

              I wasn't the most successful in accruing more following for my game; I think
              I gained a total of 6 twitter followers that night. For the most part, the
              people I met were other developers who were impressed with my work. I met a
              few really great people, and all the people organizing the event asked me
              to come back to their other events! I hope to continue participating with
              them in the future.
