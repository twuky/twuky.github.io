              Alright, so my presentation does have one school related item in it -
              but it isn't high school! My senior year class selection has been slightly
              limited - one of the reasons as to me choosing to focus on work outside
              of school. In order to fill up all the gaps in my schedule I began to take
              courses at PCC.
            </p> <p>
              The essay you just read was the first college level essay I have written.
              The course I'm taking is called Writing 121 - English Compostion
              (An entirely ordinary name by my metric). The prompt for the piece was to
              assess and explain a piece of writing by Michael Kimmel on "The Guy Code", a
              smaller section of his book Guyland. My grading was a success - 96 out of 100 -
              but that's not to say I don't have any problems. Aside from some issues with
              the writing itself, which I will likely explain during the presentation, the
              structure of the essay asked us to write as if the author was correct regardless
              of our own thoughts on the matter. I understand that the assignment was mostly
              focused on our ability to write thesis statements and properly quote sources,
              but I don't agree with the philosophy of forcing students to believe any ideal
              in this way. As an introduction to college writing, I guess I could say I'm
              getting used to those "grin and bear it" sorts of assignments.
