              Maybe it's a little unfair of me to make my own portfolio an item in my
              presentation. I like to think that I put an extraordinary amount of work
              into it. Web design is something I had no experience in whatsoever
              before deciding to make my own website for this year's portfolio. In order
              to explain my learning, I'll try to walk through the process it took me
              to build the site you're looking at today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since we did online portfolios last year I had been dreaming up making my
              own site for a presentation, from scratch. The "Google Sites" platform
              last year was fairly limiting, and while they updated it this year, most
              of the templates looked the same to me, and were pretty uninteresting. I
              decided that I was going to have to make the site myself if I wanted it to
              look nice. The only problem was that I had never worked with HTML or web
              development before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coding in HTML is fairly straightforward, and it's popular enough
              to where if you have an issue someone online has already asked and
              gotten an answer, at least for the basic stuff. A few of my friends
              online have had some web development experience, and I was able to get
              help from them as well. I've spent about two and a half months on this
              site, and have built it to work like a template I can use for a more
              personal portfolio for games and my other work.

            </p>
            <p>
              For the uninitiated,
              HTML is probably one of the worst methods of coding invented, but since
              it's the basis of the web you have to just deal with it. Everything needs
              to be inside of these little "tags", < header> some text </ header>, for
              example could be the header at the top of the page. While that in it
              of itself is simple, there are hundreds of different "tags" and basically
              none of them do anything different from the rest. I could put my header
              in a footer tag, and as long as I apply the same style settings they would
              look and act the same. Since there is arguably no difference between each
              tag, other than visual clarity for having a name, I've just resorted to
              calling everything by a "div" which is basically a catch-all for anything
              you would want to put on a website. In addition to a tag, you can give each
              element it's own class and id.

            </p><img src="pics/development_1.png"> </img>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> A mess of "tagging". </p>
            <p>
              Anything "visual" with websites isn't actually handled through HTML.
              That, of course, has to be it's own language, CSS. In order to give
              anything on screen a shape, or color, or animation, or make it properly
              spaced I need to adjust that all through CSS. Depending on what part of
              the screen the item is, I assign each div a class or id. The text box you
              are reading now has an id of "text-zone", which is in the larger white
              background div named "bot-half". Nesting all these elements within
              each other and giving them unique properties is what makes the page look
              as if it isn't just text on a white screen.

            <p>

              Right now, as of writing this the site is sitting at about 1350
              lines of code (just for the portfolio pages). Most of that is made
              up of these little open tags and closing tags. All in all it was fun
              and interesting to experiment with a new language, as frustrating as
              this one is.
